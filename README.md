# AngularJS BSCW dashboard Application

## Overview

This application takes the developer through the process of building a web-application using
angular. The application is loosely based on the **Google Phone Gallery**, which no longer
exists. Here is a historical reference: [Google Phone Gallery on WayBack](http://web.archive.org/web/20131215082038/http://www.android.com/devices/).

Each tagged commit is a separate lesson teaching a single aspect of angular.

The full tutorial can be found at http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial.
